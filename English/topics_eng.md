## 1. COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE

In a desktop computer, the CPU and storage devices are normally built inside a system unit. Other peripherals are attached to the system unit by cables and each peripheral uses its own driver card or controller. Expansion cards contain the electronics required to communicate with and control the device. Video or graphics cards are used for monitors, soundcards are used for audio input/output and NICs (network interface cards) are used for connecting to other computers in a network. Extra memory can also be added to the computer using special memory expansion slots inside the computer. A portable computer that does not have enough space inside to fit expansion cards may use an external device called a port replicator to provide connections for peripherals.

Storage devices are used to store programs and data that are not being used and before using it must be transferred from the storage device to the main memory called RAM. Hard disks consist of a set of magnetic coated disks that are vacuum-sealed inside a case to keep out the dust. The magnetic surfaces of the disks are formatted using a read/write head to provide magnetic storage areas. In server computers, hard disks can be connected together and operate as one unit using RAID. This can speed up the system and provide a way of recovering data if the system crashes.

## 2. OPERATING SYSTEMS

The operating system is a set of computer programs that allow the user to perform basic tasks like copying, moving, saving and printing files. It also provides an interface between applications programs and computer hardware. As a user interacts with an application program on the screen, the applications program communicates with the operating system that in its turn communicates with the computer hardware. The work of the operating system takes place in the background and is invisible for the user.

The most important program in an OS is the supervisor program. It remains in memory all the time that the computer is operating and manages the OS. It loads other parts of the OS into memory only when they are needed. Programs that remain in memory while the computer is in use are known as resident programs. Programs that only stay in memory while they are being used are known as non-resident programs.

Some operating systems are command driven as Unix, for example. Unix can be used on all sizes of computers but mostly large multi-user, multi-tasking mainframe computers and is available in many versions, such as Linux, Minix, Solaris and PowerOpen. Some OS have a Graphical User Interface that allows a user to use a mouse to click on icons on the screen or choose commands from a menu.

## 3. GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACES

A user interface allows a user to interact with a computer using a mouse. Microsoft Windows, for example, is a common GUI used on IBM compatible PCs. The main Windows background screen is called the desktop. Programs, files and folders are represented on the desktop by icons. Using a mouse, a user can move a mouse pointer across the screen and select icons by clicking the left mouse button. By holding the pointer over an icon (hovering), a text box known as a tooltip can be made to appear. This tooltip explains what the icon represents. Double-clicking the mouse causes the program, file or folder represented by the icon to open in a rectangular box on the screen called a window. A user can open more than one window at a time but the one with the focus is known as the active window. Windows can have vertical and horizontal scroll bars to let a user move a document up, down or across the screen respectively. A user can easily drag and drop the selected items on the screen.

Commands are displayed in a menu bar along the top of the window. Clicking on a command opens a list of choices known as a menu. Clicking on a menu item sometimes opens a submenu. A bar, known as a taskbar, is displayed along the bottom of the desktop showing what programs, files and folders are currently open. At the far right of the taskbar is a

special area called the system tray displayed icons show what resident programs are running in the background. At the far left of the taskbar there is a Start button which opens the Start menu on the screen when clicked on. The OS can be closed by choosing Shut Down option on the Start Menu. A touchscreen allows users to select icons and commands by touching the display screen with their finger instead of using a mouse.

## 4. APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS

An ASP rents applications to users so that instead of buying software, the user pays for using applications as and when they need them. The ASP provides the required software, manages the hardware and provides storage space, security controls and the physical links to their customers. The ASP normally leases storage space for programs and data from Data Centres owned by data storage specialists. The user is provided with remote access to a wide variety of programs including generic applications as Email and office suites, business services, such as payroll and accounting systems, expensive specialist tools and e-commerce resources. Therefore, small businesses have the opportunity to use such tools for short periods of time as and when they need them, rather than having to buy the software as a permanent investment. This gives the ASP customer more flexibility and they don’t have to install and maintain programs, upgrade, deal with viruses and manage email systems.

However, there are some potential pitfalls. To use applications remotely requires a lot of a bandwidth which is really available from a broadband connections or a leased line to the ASP itself. It is also important to ensure that the ASP will be able to provide a secure, reliable service which will be available whenever you need it. Nevertheless, the idea of ASP use is rather progressive and is a background of Cloud Computing concept popular nowadays.

## 5. MULTIMEDIA

Multimedia is a term used to refer to a combination of text, graphics, animation, sound and video. Let’s discuss some popular multimedia terms.

MP3 (MPEG Audio Layer3) is a standard way of storing compressed, digital audio files. Digital audio is created by sampling sound 44,000 times a second and storing a code number to represent each sound sample. The files are compressed by removing any sounds that are inaudible to the human ear, making them much smaller than files created using other digital audio storage standards, such as WAV. The size of an audio file is commonly measured in MB, whereas the frequency of a sound is measured in kilohertz (kHz). MP3 files have extra code added, called tags that give the user information about the file. Due to their small size, MP3 files are more suitable for transferring across the Internet.

MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a standard way of connecting musical instruments, music synthesizers and computers. A piece of electronics called MIDI Interface Board is installed on each device to enable the device to communicate using MIDI standards. As music is being played, it can be displayed on a monitor screen as a musical score and then edited with a computer program using all the features of a mixing desk, stored and printed. MIDI systems do not store the actual sound. Instead of tit the sound is encoded in the form of 8-bit bytes of digital information.

MPEG is a method of compressing and decompressing video signals. It works like this. The single data stream off the CD-ROM is split into video and audio components, which are then decompressed using separate algorithms. MPEG stands for Motion Picture Experts Group, an organisation that develops standards for audio and video compression.

## 6. NETWORKS

Computers and peripherals connected together form a network. Networks allow communication between computers and the sharing of hardware (such as printers) and software (programs and data). A network that covers a small area as an office or building is known as LAN (local area network). The main computers that provide services on the network are called servers. A file server, for example, provides a central storage area for data files. The computers that use the services are known as clients. The computers can be connected using various types of cabling, including the ordinary telephone system wiring. A main data communications cable connecting LANs together is referred to as backbone.

Various electronic devices are also used to amplify, filter and determine the best path for the signals. These include bridges for dividing a LAN into separate parts or connecting similar networks together, gateways for connecting different types of networks and routers for connecting different networks together, determining the best route for the signals and forming the Internet. A modem (modulator/demodulator) is used to convert signals from analogue (having a variety of levels) to digital (having only two levels, representing on and off) for connection to the ordinary telephone system. Alternatively, an ISDN adapter or a DSL modem can be used to allow digital signals to be used without being converted to analogue signals.

## 7. LAN TYPES

There are different standard methods of connecting computers in a LAN. One of the most common is known as Ethernet. Each computer must have a network adapter which is usually in the form of an expansion card known as a network interface card (NIC). All the computers are connected through another electronic device called a hub. The electronics in the hub are used to amplify the signals to prevent them from becoming too weak before they reach the desired computer. The cable normally used to connect the computers to the hub is known as twisted-pair cabling. Its two cables twisted together eliminate interference from external signals. In a home network, the mains power cables built into the house can be used instead if electronic devices called isolation adapters are used to isolate the computer from the mains electricity running through the cable. Nowadays, wireless networks use a radio transmitter and a receiver tuned to use the same radio frequency, instead of cabling.

In a client/ server network the main server computer provides the services and the attached client computers can be normal computers or simple terminals. Terminals require the server to do most of all the processing. A thin client (or thin terminal), such as a NetPC, has a processor that does some of the processing, whereas a dumb terminal does not have a processor and all the processing has to be done by the server computer.

## 8. COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION (CMC)

Computer-mediated communication is a term used to describe systems that allow users to communicate using a computer network. Moreover, CMC has recently become new national pastime among young people.

At present most of this communication is written, although video- and audio-conferencing permit speech. Most computer-mediated communication is asynchronous. That means that the participants are not on line at the same time and there are delays between messages. The examples are : mobile phone text messages, chat rooms, emails, bulletin boards and news- or discussion groups. Synchronous CMC depends on participants being on line at the same time. There may be a few seconds delay but, nevertheless, this kind of communication is closer to face-to-face interaction. Examples of synchronous communication include: Internet Relay Chat, MOOs, audio- and video-conferencing.

With the exception of video-conferencing, there is no opportunity for paralinguistic features such as gesture. To compensate, users have developed a number of strategies including: abbreviations and acronyms (e.g. LOL – lots of laughs), simplified syntax and other symbols and exclamation marks to express emotional meaning. Symbols indicating emotions are called emoticons and phrases called emotes display action in chat rooms.

## 9. THE WORLD WIDE WEB

The World Wide Web is a service on the Internet. It consists of sets of linked documents known as webpages which can be viewed using a program called a browser. The links on a webpage are called hyperlinks and contain the Web address of the webpage. The Web address of a webpage is also known as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). When a user clicks on a hyperlink on a webpage, the browser program contacts a server computer known as DNS (Domain Name System) server to look up the IP address of the remote Web server computer. The DNS has a stored table of names and addresses of nodes on the Internet. The request for the linked web page is then sent to a computer or electronic device known as a router. It uses the Internet address obtained from the DNS server to route the request.

The message requesting the webpage is divided into packets and each separate data packet is passed from router to router until they all reach the remote Web server. Then they are put back together again. The remote Web server sends the requested webpage back to the browser computer that made the request in a similar way using IP address of the browser computer to determine the best available route for each packet. When the packets arrive at the browser computer, they are combined and the requested webpage is displayed in the browser.

## 10. DATA SECURITY

There are a variety of different crimes that can be committed in computing sphere, including spreading viruses, Trojan horse, mail bombing, phishing, Denial of Service attack and others. A computer virus is a program that can reproduce itself and causes damage of infected computer or makes it to behave in an unusual way. Moreover, it infects other programs called host programs by attaching to them and reproducing itself. It is done by replacing the first instruction in the host program with a JUMP command that changes the normal instruction sequence in the program and as a result the virus instructions are executed.

When a virus attaches to operating system programs, it is said to have patched the OS. Viruses are normally attached to command files (.COM extension files) or executable files (.EXE files). A virus is loaded into memory when infected program is run or executed. Therefore, the virus then becomes a memory resident and stays there until the computer is switched off. When a virus is triggered by a predetermined event, it operates the payload. Viruses usually have 4 main parts:

* A misdirection routine that enables it to hide itself
* A reproduction routine that allows it to copy itself into other programs
* A trigger that causes the payload
* A payload that causes the damage and may be a harmless joke or very destructive.

A program that has a payload but does not have a reproduction routine is known as a Trojan.

## 11.  COMPUTERS IN OUR LIFE

Nowadays, we cannot imagine our life without computers and the fact is that they have become so important that nothing can replace them. They seem to be everywhere today. Since 1948 when the first real computer has been invented, our life has changed so much that we can call it a real digital revolution. Computers improve our lives. They are very useful in office work, we can write texts such as reports and make analysis, and we can communicate with the whole world very fast and cheap using Internet. Computers can calculate and process information faster and more accurate than humans.

Unlike most machines, computers do not have a fixed purpose. They are multi-purpose tools. They can be used in a wide variety of situations including security systems, cars and phones. Advanced systems like medical expert systems, for example, can help doctors diagnose an illness and decide on the best treatment. Also computers have become irreplaceable in banking system. All data is stored on special hard disks and paper isn't used in accountancy any more. Furthermore, architects, designers and engineers can't imagine their work without computers.

As computer systems are developed, they are becoming more common and are being used for more and more purposes. People – computer users and computer professionals – are the ones who will decide how to use and develop information technology not only efficiently but in a socially responsible way.

## 12. CACHE MEMORY. HOW IT WORKS.

One of the most important techniques to make the time taken to move data in and out of computer memory shorter is known as Cache Memory. The idea is to use a small number of very fast memory chips as a buffer between main memory and the processor. Whenever the processor needs to read data it looks in this cache area first. Only if data is not in the cache, the processor has to go through the more laborious and time-consuming process of reading data from the main memory. The whole process is controlled by cache controller which looks after cache coherency. That means that any changes written to main memory are reflected within the cache and vice versa.

Disk caching works in the same way whether you have a cache on your disk or you are using a software-based solution. First, the CPU requests the new data. If the data is not in the cache, the cache itself requests the data from the hard disk. The data is read from the hard disk including data adjacent to it. The cache replaces old data with the requested data. Depending on the algorithm being used, the cache replaces either the information that has been in the cache the longest or the least recently used. After that, the cache supplies CPU with requested data. Moreover, the cache already has the adjacent data which was loaded alongside with the requested data and can use it as soon as the CPU makes a similar request which of course is very convenient and speeds up the whole process.
